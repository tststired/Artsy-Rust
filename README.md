This project aims to translate written instructions into corresponding visual representations. The core functionality is built around interpreting simple written commands such as "up," "down," or numerical values like "50," and transforming them into relevant images. This simple program can create some surprising patterns.

Features
Text-to-Image Translation: Converts written commands like "up," "down," "50," etc., into visual elements.
Programming logic: Conditionals and Loops 
Dynamic Visualization: The images can represent movement, size changes, or other actions based on the written description.
Simple Commands Support: Handle basic directional (e.g., "up," "down") and numeric inputs (e.g., "50," "100").
Customizable Output: Users can adjust how the images are generated, such as colors, shapes, or graphical styles.

To run the project, use the following command ```cargo run```
